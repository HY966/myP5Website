In this project, I investigated how optical illusions trick the brain by playing with patterns, shapes, and colors. I studied some examples of classic illusions to understand how they work. I then made some sketches and designed the final piece using p5.js. I experimented with different shapes and color contrasts to create the illusion and adjusted small details like spacing and angles.
In my code, I created a dynamic rotating pattern that uses random color changes and smooth movements to produce a hypnotic effect. The graphic alternates between black, white and blue as it rotates around the center of the canvas. I used sine and cosine functions to control the position of each segment, which changes slightly over time to give the illusion of continuous movement. The constantly changing colors and moving shapes make it look like the drawing is constantly changing, even though the structure remains the same.
